# ifdef DELTA_COMPILER

// A CompileTimeClosure represents a block closure at compile time. It holds the noninlined
// block method and a unique identification of the compiled & customized home method
// (the non-block method lexically enclosing the block). CompileTimeClosures are needed to
// distinguish multiple versions of the same source block at compile time.  Multiple
// versions can exist when the block's home method is inlined several times.
//
// Note: Having a closure stub doesn't mean that there exists a blockClosureOop at
// run-time.  If the block is inlined, none of this ever matters.  However, if a 
// block belonging to a compiled method can potentially be created at run-time, it 
// must be different from other versions of the same method (i.e., it must be customized to 
// the version of its home method).  This customization is achieved by putting different
// code addresses in the blockClosureOops so they invoke different nmethods.
